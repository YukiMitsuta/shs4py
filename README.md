# Requirement

* Python 3
* fasteners
* numpy
* scipy

In addition, next packages are required to accelerate the calculations.

* Cython

In calculations of free energy surfaces of metadynamics, further accerelation can be applied.
If your workstation use MPI multiprocessing, you can use multisred calculation by using next package.

* mpi4py

Furthermore, you can use GPGPU acceleration by using next package.

* cupy


# Note

I don't test environments under Windows.
If you use this script, please refer the next article.
